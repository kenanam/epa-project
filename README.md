## üìå Project Analysis (300 words)

This project demonstrates the automated deployment and management of a WordPress e-commerce website with an AI chatbot, utilising AWS CloudFormation for immutable infrastructure provisioning. It provides two EC2 instances: a frontend server running WordPress with the chatbot plugin, and a backend server hosting a MariaDB database, ensuring consistent, scalable deployments (K7, S18, K12, S7, K8, S5).

Continuous integration and deployment are fully automated through GitHub Actions, including unit tests with Jest, significantly enhancing code quality, accelerating deployment cycles, and reducing manual intervention (K1, K14, K15, S14, S15). Collaboration is efficiently managed through Git branching and pull requests, ensuring transparent development workflows (K2, S20).

Security and data protection are effectively addressed through Cloudflare's SSL encryption, DDoS mitigation, and proactive threat monitoring, integrated seamlessly into workflows (K5, K16, K17, S9, S10). AWS CloudWatch delivers comprehensive monitoring, collecting detailed metrics and logs, and configured with proactive alerting for rapid issue identification and resolution (K11, S6, S19).

MariaDB handles data persistence reliably, with automated backups securely stored in AWS S3, supporting robust disaster recovery strategies (K12). Automation scripts written in Bash streamline the installation and configuration processes, reducing errors and manual workload (K13, S12, S17).

Clearly articulated user stories managed via GitHub Issues ensure user needs and acceptance criteria are transparently understood and accurately delivered (K10, S3). Incremental refactoring via controlled commits improves architecture stability and functionality over time without disruption (S22). Adopting the "You build it, you run it" approach, the project exhibits proactive monitoring, continuous improvement, and ownership accountability, documented effectively through resolved GitHub Issues (B3, S11).
